# Learning Log - M1A3 GitHub Repository Management

**Student:** Joshua Klein  
**Date:** 11/1/25

## What I Learned
In this assignment, I learned:
- I learned about setting up my own repository and creating issues.
- Issues allow the authors to see what kind of features the community is interested in and find bugs that they missed.
- Open source projects are intended to be used and modified by the users, who wouldn't be able to do that if they didn't know how because of missing documentation.

## Challenges and Solutions
I did not find any parts of this project particularly problematic. It was useful for learning to set up a basic GitHub repository.

## Connection to My GIS Career
Once I graduate I am interested in using GitHub for personal projects. Additionally I am planning on adding my GitHub link to my resume once there is something on it.

## Open Source Workflow Understanding
Creating my own repository (`hello-gist604b`) mirrors the open source contribution process. In real projects, developers fork existing repositories, make improvements, and submit contributions - similar to how I created this repository and linked it to the assignment system.
